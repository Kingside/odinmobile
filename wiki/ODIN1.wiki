== Nomenclature ==
The identifier generated in this implementation of ODIN is officially designated ODIN-1. In the event of a major revision, the new identifier will be termed ODIN-2 and so forth.

== Generating an ODIN-1 == 
Creating an ODIN-1 is designed to be as simple as possible:

1. *Identifier Seed Step*: Lookup the following Identifier Seed for each of the following platforms:
|| || iOS || Android || Windows Phone ||
|| Identifier Seed || 802.11 MAC Address || ANDROID_ID || DeviceUniqueId ||

2. *Hash Step*: Pass the Identifier Seed through the SHA-1 hash function.

3.The resulting message digest is ODIN-1.

==Security==

Because ODIN-1 is personally identifying information, any ODIN-1 must not be transmitted over unsecure connections as plain text.
